This will allow users to select how many results they want per page and this property will check to see if the number of results requested by the user exceeds the MaxPageSize private field we set above. If it does, we don't allow this ad we allow the user to only have the MaxPageSize which is 50. If the requested page size is below 50, then we allow the _pageSize field to be set to what the user wants.
